So after much cajoling and harumphing, I've finally set up my blog.

Wow. Much content. Such thoughts.

At the very least, this will help me get out some of my thoughts in a more long-form format without the distractions of other content.

I figure the format for this blog will mostly be me reacting to various news stories. Maybe sometimes it'll be me talking about my experience poking around with a tech thing.

At the very least, it's nice to have a place like this, even if nobody ever reads it.
