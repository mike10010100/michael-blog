Former child actor turned Dev turned DevOps Engineer. I spend my time on hacking, 3D printing, IoT, and politics — not necessarily in that order.

I work in infrastructure and platform engineering. This blog is where I think out loud about technology, current events, and whatever else is on my mind.

All thoughts here are my own and not my employers'.
