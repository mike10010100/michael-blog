Reminder: civility rules that have no examples nor specific guidelines are a subjective way to ensure that trolls control the entire board.

Civility rules only punish those who act in good faith. Bad faith actors can simply create a new account or run away. Good faith actors will be forced to either act like a saint and ignore obvious trolling and insults, or be banned like the instigator.

Subjective civility rules also allow any content a given moderator does not like to suddenly and inexplicably fall under the ban. This is often justified by saying that someone was arguing in bad faith, and was therefore in violation of civility rules.

In summary: reddit is a failed state, their moderators are compromised, and there isn't a single thing anyone can do about it.
