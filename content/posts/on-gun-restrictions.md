## "Cars and knives can kill people too! Why aren't we banning guns?"

Because guns are purpose-build to kill, maim, or injure their targets. Full stop. They were invented as an advancement on technology designed to kill.

This is one of the many disingenuous arguments you are likely to hear from the pro-gun crowd.
